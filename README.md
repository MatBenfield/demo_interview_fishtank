# Demo Interview Fish tank
 
A fish tank interview style question and solution in dotnet core console, class library, and Nunit tests.

I Need a new C# Class library (any .net version) to help me manage my fish tank. Don't worry about the UI: I will build that
The library should satisfy the following user stories and demonstrate your design, coding and testing abilities.

## Here are the user stories

 1. A user should be able to add 3 types of fish to the tank (Gold, Angel, and Babel) and name them");
 2. A user should be able to see how much food to put in the tank with a `Tank.Feed()` method. This should return the weight in grams of the total required fish food.
   0.1g for each Gold, 0.2g for each Angel, and 0.3g for each Babel fish.

Ensure the design allows me to add more types of fish in the future without having to change the tank class.
